# double precision float\n\nbranch\\_time\\_in\\_parent = 3650.0D0; # double precision float\n\nparent\\_time\\_units = \u201cdays since 1000-1-1\u201d; # character string\n</code></pre> <p>If the calendar used in the parent is different from the child, then the parent\u2019s calendar should be recorded in \u201cparent_time_units\u201d.\u00a0 The CV for the calendar is the same as that for the CF calendar attribute. For example in the above case, if the child\u2019s calendar is \u201cgregorian\u201d, but the parent\u2019s is \u201cnoleap\u201d, then parent_time_units=\u201ddays since 1000-1-1 (noleap)\u201d.\u00a0</p> <p>As another example, suppose a ScenarioMIP simulation \u201cbranches\u201d from a historical run at the date 2015-1-1.\u00a0 Suppose a noleap calendar is used in each and both have units of \u201cdays since 1850-1-1\u201d.\u00a0 (Note that ScenarioMIP simulations should always adopt the same units as the historical parent.)\u00a0 In this case the following global attributes should appear in the ScenarioMIP output file:</p> <pre><code>branch\\_time\\_in\\_child = 60225.0D0\n\nbranch\\_time\\_in\\_parent = 60225.0D0\n\nparent\\_time\\_units = \u201cdays since 1850-1-1\u201d.\n</code></pre> <p>As a third example, consider a decadal prediction experiment initialized from observations (e.g., from an \u201canalysis\u201d).\u00a0 In this case there is no parent so none of these attributes should be included.\u00a0 (Note that the initialization time of the decadal prediction experiments will be recorded as a scalar coordinate dimension, pointed to by the \u201ccoordinates\u201d attribute, which is attached to each variable.)</p> </li> <li> <p>A description and examples of this global attribute may be found in the document: CMIP5_output_metadata_requirements (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/docs/CMIP5_output_metadata_requirements.pdf).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>creation_date form: YYYY-MM-DD_T_HH:MM:_SS_Z\u00a0 (e.g., \u201c2010-03-23T05:56:23Z\u201d)</p> </li> <li> <p>For a given experiment, the realization_index, initialization_index, physics_index, and forcing_index are used to uniquely identify each simulation of an ensemble of runs contributed by a single model.\u00a0 These indices are defined as follows:\\    \u00a0</p> <ul> <li> <p>realization_index = an integer (\u22651) distinguishing among members of an ensemble of simulations that differ only in their initial conditions (e.g., initialized from different points in a control run).\u00a0 Note that if two different simulations were started from the same initial conditions, the same realization number should be used for both simulations.\u00a0 For example if a historical run with \u201cnatural forcing\u201d only and another historical run that includes anthropogenic forcing were both spawned at the same point in a control run, both should be assigned the same realization.\u00a0 Also, each so-called RCP (future scenario) simulation should normally be assigned the same realization integer as the historical run from which it was initiated.\u00a0 This will allow users to easily splice together the appropriate historical and future runs.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>initialization_index = an integer (\u22651), which should be assigned a value of 1 except to distinguish simulations performed under the same conditions but with different initialization procedures.\u00a0 In CMIP6 this index should invariably be assigned the value \u201c1\u201d except for some hindcast and forecast experiments called for by the DCPP activity.\u00a0 The initialization_index can be used either to distinguish between different algorithms used to impose initial conditions on a forecast or to distinguish between different observational datasets used to initialize a forecast.</p> </li> <li> <p>physics_index = an integer (\u22651) identifying the physics version used by the model.\u00a0 In the usual case of a single physics version of a model, this argument should normally be assigned the value 1, but it is essential that a consistent assignment of physics_index be used across all simulations performed by a particular model.\u00a0 Use of\u00a0 \u201cphysics_index\u201d is reserved for closely-related model versions (e.g., as in a \u201cperturbed physics\u201d ensemble) or for the same model run with slightly different parameterizations (e.g., of cloud physics).\u00a0 Model versions that are substantially different from one another should be given a different source_id\u201d (rather than simply assigning a different value of the physics_index).\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>forcing_index = an integer (\u22651) used to distinguish runs conforming to the protocol of a single CMIP6 experiment, but with different variants of forcing applied.\u00a0 One can, for example, distinguish between two historical simulations, one forced with the CMIP6-recommended forcing data sets and another forced by a different dataset, which might yield information about how forcing uncertainty affects the simulation.\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each data provider can assign whatever positive integers they like\u00a0 for the realization_index, intialization_index, physics_index, and forcing index.\u00a0 For each source/experiment pair, however, consistency (in these indices) should be maintained across each parent/child pair whenever sensible (so that, for example, both the ScenarioMIP child and its \u201chistorical\u201d parent simulation would be assigned the same set of index values for realization, initialization, and physics); the integer 1 should normally be chosen for each of these in the case of a single variant or for the primary variant (if there is one).\u00a0 This is only a suggestion, however; there should be no expectation on the part of users that every model will have a value of 1 assigned to any of the r, i, p, f indices, and even if a 1 is assigned it does not imply that it is the primary variant.\u00a0 Note also that a child spawned by a control run will not\u00a0 necessarily have the same \u201cripf\u201d value as the control,\u00a0 since, for example, multiple realizations of an experiment will\u00a0 branch from the same control.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Note that none of the \u201cripf\u201d indices can be omitted.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Example of a variant_label:\u00a0 if realization_index=2, initialization_index=1, physics_index=3, and forcing_index=233, then variant_label =

documents.</p> </li> <li> <p>The \u201cgrid\u201d global attribute can be used to describe the horizontal grid and regridding procedure. \u00a0 There is no standard form used to record this information, but it is suggested that when appropriate the following be indicated:\u00a0 brief description of native grid and resolution, and if data have been regridded, regridding procedure and description of target grid.\u00a0 Here are some examples:</p> <pre><code>grid = \u201cnative atmosphere T63 gaussian grid (128x64 lonxlat)\u201d\n\ngrid = \u201cdata regridded to a CMIP6 standard 1x1 degree lonxlat grid from the native T63 grid using an area-average preserving method.\u201d\n\ngrid = \u201cdata regridded via\u00a0 bilinear interpolation to a 3x3 deg lonxlat grid from the native atmosphere T63 gaussian grid (128x64 lonxlat)\u201d\n\ngrid = \u201cnative ocean tri-polar grid with 43200 ocean cells\u201d\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Modeling groups may choose to report their output on the model\u2019s native grid and/or regrid it to one or more target grids.\u00a0 To distinguish between output reported on different grids,\u00a0 a \u201cgrid_label\u201d attribute is defined.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>The rules for assigning grid labels\u00a0 should make it easy for users to select (using the ESGF search tools) CMIP output that is on a grid considered by each modeling group to best represent its model -- the so-called \u201cprimary\u201d grid.\u00a0 If output is reported on the native grid, this is always deemed the \u201cprimary\u201d grid.\u00a0 If output is not reported on the native grid, then modeling groups should regrid the data to some primary grid of its choosing \u00a0 For the \u201cprimary\u201d grid the following labels apply:</p> <pre><code>grid_label = \"gn\"\u00a0 (output is reported on the native grid, usually but not invariably at grid cell centers)\ngrid_label = \"gr\"\u00a0\u00a0 (output is _not_ reported on the native grid, but instead is regridded by the modeling group to a \u201cprimary grid\u201d of its choosing)\u00a0\ngrid_label = \u201cgm\u201d (global mean output is reported, so data are not gridded)\n</code></pre> <p>As noted below sometimes a \u201cz\u201d or \u201ca\u201d or \u201cg\u201d is appended to the labels to indicate \u201czonal means\u201d or grids limited to Antarctica or Greenland.\u00a0</p> <p>If besides the \u201cprimary\u201d grid, output is regridded to an additional grid, then for this output <code>grid_label = \"gr[i]\"</code>\u00a0 (a \u201csecondary\u201d grid), where <code>[i]</code> should be replaced by a positive\u00a0 integer less than 10, which distinguishes this output from other\u00a0 regridded output.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Note that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If model output is reported on a native grid, then if regridded output is also reported, it must not be labeled \u201cgr\u201d, but instead should be of the form gr[i] (e.g,, gr1, gr2, \u2026.).\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>The grid label provides no information about the grid other than to indicate whether or not the data have been regridded (from the native grid) and whether or not the grid is considered to be a \u201cprimary\u201d grid by the data provider.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Output for different variables may be reported on different grids, so \u201cgn\u201d and \u201cgr\u201d may not uniquely define a grid even within a single model.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a variable is reported on more than one grid,\u00a0 one of these grids must be labeled \u201cgn\u201d or \u201cgr\u201d (as appropriate), and others must be labeled as secondary grids (\u201cgr1\u201d, \u201cgr2\u201d, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>The grid labels (\u201cgr1\u201d, \u201cgr2\u201d, etc.)\u00a0 must be defined consistently for all variables reported from a single model on the same secondary grid.\u00a0 Thus,\u00a0 if \u201cgr3\u201d indicates output on a 2x2 degree grid for one variable, then the same label should be used for other variables output on this grid (unless for another variable output is considered to be primary, in which case the output would be labeled \u201cgn\u201d or \u201cgr\u201d, as appropriate).</p> </li> <li> <p>Output on the same grid but from different models will usually not be labeled with the same grid_label, since data providers independently assign the labels.</p> </li> <li> <p>A \u201cnominal_resolution\u201d attribute must be defined as specified in Appendix 2, and a brief description of the grid should be recorded in the \u201cgrid\u201d global attribute (see note 10).</p> </li> <li> <p>For zonal mean output, a \u201cz\u201d should be appended to the grid label that would apply before performing the zonal mean (e.g., \"gnz\", \"grz\", \"gr2z\").\u00a0 The \"gnz\" label would likely only be appropriate when zonally-averaging data on a native cartesian latxlon grid.</p> </li> <li> <p>For \u201csite\u201d data the label \"gn\" should be used presuming data are obtained from the single native grid cell located nearest each site.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>For \u201ctransport through a straight\u201d (and the like), the grid label should reflect the grid relied on in calculating the transport (presumably the native grid would be best for this purpose, so \u201cgn\u201d).</p> </li> <li> <p>For output reported only over the region centered on Greenland, \u201cg\u201d should be appended to the grid_label (e.g., \u201cgng\u201d, \u201cgrg\u201d,\u00a0 \u201cgr1g\u201d).\u00a0 Similarly for output reported only over the region centered on Antarctica, \u201ca\u201d should be appended to the grid_label.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The

for Labeling Experiments","text":"<p>Global attributes that label experiments are needed to construct filenames and directories and can generally be used as search facets.\u00a0 Together, they should have the following characteristics:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Uniquely label each experiment within CMIP6 and distinguish experiments with specified conditions that differ in any way\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Easily be interpreted and remembered</p> </li> <li> <p>Facilitate representations of groups of experiments that are closely related (e.g., same forecast conditions but different start dates, or experiment with an \u201coffline\u201d model driven by output from various models)\u00a0</p> </li> </ul> <p>Often several simulations will be performed that satisfy the conditions specified for an experiment.\u00a0 For example, simulations of the historical period can branch from various points in a control run, and each of these will satisfy the conditions defining the experiment.\u00a0 Together, such simulations constitute a \u201cconforming ensemble\u201d with members all satisfying the same experiment specifications.\u00a0 There are also occasional cases where the experiment designers (MIP leaders) define a family of related simulations and choose to label these with a common \u201croot\u201d experiment name, followed by a \u201csub-experiment\u201d name.\u00a0 An example of this is the set of decadal prediction hindcasts that are all run similarly but started from different start dates (with each simulation identified by a different sub-experiment label). \u00a0 Such \u201cdefined ensembles\u201d of experiments will be labeled with a \u201croot\u201d experiment name, and a \u201csub-experiment_id\u201d will be used to distinguish among members in the ensemble.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>To accommodate the various CMIP6 experiments, we define three global attributes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>experiment_id: the label identifying the \u201croot\u201d experiment</p>

indices stored as global attributes:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>variant_label = <code>r&lt;k&gt;i&lt;l&gt;p&lt;m&gt;f&lt;n&gt;</code></p> <p>where</p> <ul> <li> <p>k = realization_index</p> </li> <li> <p>l = initialization_index</p> </li> <li> <p>m = physics_index</p> </li> <li> <p>n = forcing_index</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Besides the above identifiers, additional descriptive information concerning the experiment is provided by the following global attributes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>experiment: brief descriptor of experiment (using CV)</p> </li> <li> <p>sub_experiment: brief descriptor of sub-experiment (using CV); if sub_experiment_id = \u201cnone\u201d, then sub_experiment = \u201cnone\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>variant_info: brief descriptor of what is unique about this \u201cripf\u201d variant.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For the group of experiments included in CMIP6, the following structure will usually be followed:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Each experiment_id will comprise one or more segments separated by hyphens.</p> </li> <li> <p>The first segment indicates that an experiment should be run with a model other than an AOGCM or a concentration-driven ESM.\u00a0 (This segment is omitted in experiments for AOGCMs and concentration-driven ESMs.)\u00a0 CMIP6 examples of the first segment (shown in parentheses) include:</p> </li> <li> <p>Offline radiation code experiments (\u201crad\u201d)</p> </li> <li> <p>Uncoupled ice-sheet models forced by AOGCM output (\u201cism\u201d)</p> </li> <li> <p>Atmosphere (and land surface) models forced by prescribed SSTs and sea ice

The requested output fields can be determined as described above, and as in CMIP5, the data must be \u201ccmorized\u201d (i.e., written in conformance with all the CMIP standards). The CMIP standards build on the CF-conventions, which define metadata that provide a description of the variables and their spatial and temporal properties. This facilitates analysis of the data by users who can read and interpret data from all models in the same way.</p> <p>As described in section 6, it is recommended, but not required, that the CMOR software library be used to rewrite model output in conformance with the standards.

Many of these are recognized by CMOR (through input via the CMIP6 CMOR Tables), which will ensure compliance.</p> <p>Note that in the above, controlled vocabularies (CV\u2019s) play a key role in ensuring uniformity in the description of data sets across all models. For all but variable-specific information, reference CV\u2019s are being maintained by PCMDI against which all quality assurance checks will be performed.

Additional, variable-specific CVs are part of the CMIP6 Data Request. These CV\u2019s are structured in a way that makes clear relationships between certain items appearing in separate CV\u2019s.

This package was first used in CMIP3 and has been generalized and improved for each new CMIP phase. Use of CMOR is not mandatory, but past experience suggests that many common errors in model output files can be avoided by its use.</p> <p>For those not using CMOR, some checks for compliance with CMIP specifications can be performed using a new code developed in support of CMIP6: the Pre-Publication Attribute Reviewer for ESGF (PrePARE). For information about tests performed by PrePARE, view the design requirements. PrePARE is included as part of the CMOR software suite and all files produced by CMOR are effectively checked by PrePARE, but PrePARE can be invoked without using CMOR to write the output.</p> <p>In addition to PrePARE, tests for file compliance with the CF-conventions can be made using a tool called the CF-checker. Both PrePARE and the CF-checker will be run as part of the ESGF publication job stream, and only files passing all tests will be published and made available for download.</p> <p>It should be noted if data are written using CMOR, additional checks will be performed that will, for example:</p> <ul> <li>Guarantee that the metadata associated with each variable is recorded in the  file (PrePARE only checks some of the variable attributes)</li> <li>Check for monotonicity of a coordinate values</li> <li>Check for \"gaps\" in the time coordinates</li> <li>Check that coordinates are stored in the right direction (and for the longitude coordinate check that the range is correct)</li> <li>Check that data values are within limits specified in the cmor tables (but for  most variables, this won't happen since limits are yet to be defined)</li> </ul> <p>Additional codes useful in preparing model output for CMIP6 include:</p> <ul> <li>Code to create regridding weights: not yet available</li> <li> <p>Code to calculate nominal_resolution: For the common case of a regular spherical coordinate (latitude x longitude) global grid, the nominal_resolution can be calculated using a formula given in Appendix 2 of the CMIP6 netCDF global attributes document.

Certain ESGF data nodes (known as \u201cTier 1 nodes\u201d) will serve as the primary access points to the data.

If the node hosting the data has not been designated \u201cTier 1\u201d, then one  of the Tier 1 nodes will have to be selected to serve as the publication site.  Improperly configured data nodes will not be accessible through the federated  ESGF system</li> <li>Data transfer and ESGF data management: In addition to putting in place a  procedure for smoothly transferring and publishing CMIP6 data, a clearly defined  process for handling corrections to flawed data should be established. This would  include a formal procedure for recording \u201cerrata\u201d information in the case of correction  and replacement of erroneous data</li> <li>Data publication: The ESGF data node managers are responsible for ESGF data  publication and storage as described more completely in the \"ESGF Data Node Managers and Operators\"  guide. Publication of data not meeting the minimal CMIP6 data quality requirements  will be blocked</li> <li>Data replication: Some of the Tier 1 nodes plan to replicate some of the  data published by other nodes. This will provide some redundancy across the federation  protecting against loss of at least some of the data in the event of a catastrophic  storage failure at one node. It will also provide a backup source of data when  one node is temporarily offline. Not all data will be replicated, so it is recommended  that modeling groups retain a backup copy of their model output</li> <li>Data access: After data publication the CMIP6 data (as well as associated  errata information, documentation and citation information) will be visible and  accessible via the following designated CMIP6 data portals: PCMDI,  DKRZ, IPSL, CEDA, and others</li> <li>Data long-term archival: A \u201csnapshot\u201d of CMIP6 data as it exists at the time  of a deadline imposed by the IPCC\u2019s 6th Assessment Report (IPCC-AR6) will be archived  at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC DDC, http://ipcc-data.org)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CMIP6/guidance_for_modellers/#8-documentation-process","title":"8.
