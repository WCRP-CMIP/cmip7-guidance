\u201cfixed historical forcing from year 1850 was applied for a 20 year spin-up period, after which the historically-evolving forcing was imposed.\u201d\u00a0 For a run that had not been spawned from a parent, this attribute should be omitted or set to \u201cno parent\u201d.\u00a0 \u00a0 If external documentation describing the branch method can be retrieved using the url recorded in the further_info_url global attribute, then branch_method may be set to \u201csee further_info_url\u201d, but it is better to provide a brief description as in the examples above.\u00a0 For runs simply restarted from some point in the parent (without special procedures applied), branch_method should be set to \u201cstandard\u201d.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>The three attributes related to branching time (branch_time_in_child, branch_time_in_parent, parent_time_units) must be included if branch time is needed\u00a0 to correctly interpret the data (e.g., in simulations spawned from a pre-industrial control run that has not reached equilibrium).\u00a0 Suppose a model with a \u201cnoleap\u201d calendar carries out a control run with the time coordinate reported in units of \u201cdays since 1000-1-1\u201d.\u00a0 Now suppose a historical simulation branches from that control run at day 3650 (i.e., on the date: 1010-1-1), and suppose the units of the time coordinate for the historical run are \u201cdays since 1850-01-01\u201d.\u00a0 Then in the historical run, the following global attributes should appear:</p> <pre><code>branch_time_in_child = 0.0D0; # double precision float\nbranch_time_in_parent = 3650.0D0; # double precision float\nparent_time_units = \u201cdays since 1000-1-1\u201d; # character string\n</code></pre> <p>If the calendar used in the parent is different from the child, then the parent\u2019s calendar should be recorded in \u201cparent_time_units\u201d.\u00a0 The CV for the calendar is the same as that for the CF calendar attribute. For example in the above case, if the child\u2019s calendar is \u201cgregorian\u201d, but the parent\u2019s is \u201cnoleap\u201d, then parent_time_units=\u201ddays since 1000-1-1 (noleap)\u201d.\u00a0</p> <p>As another example, suppose a ScenarioMIP simulation \u201cbranches\u201d from a historical run at the date 2015-1-1.\u00a0 Suppose a noleap calendar is used in each and both have units of \u201cdays since 1850-1-1\u201d.\u00a0 (Note that ScenarioMIP simulations should always adopt the same units as the historical parent.)\u00a0 In this case the following global attributes should appear in the ScenarioMIP output file:</p> <pre><code>branch_time_in_child = 60225.0D0\nbranch_time_in_parent = 60225.0D0\nparent_time_units = \u201cdays since 1850-1-1\u201d.\n</code></pre> <p>As a third example, consider a decadal prediction experiment initialized from observations (e.g., from an \u201canalysis\u201d).\u00a0 In this case there is no parent so none of these attributes should be included.\u00a0 (Note that the initialization time of the decadal prediction experiments will be recorded as a scalar coordinate dimension, pointed to by the \u201ccoordinates\u201d attribute, which is attached to each variable.)</p> </li> <li> <p>A description and examples of this global attribute may be found in the document: CMIP5_output_metadata_requirements (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/docs/CMIP5_output_metadata_requirements.pdf).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>creation_date form: <code>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ</code>\u00a0 (e.g., \u201c2010-03-23T05:56:23Z\u201d)</p> </li> <li> <p>For a given experiment, the realization_index, initialization_index, physics_index, and forcing_index are used to uniquely identify each simulation of an ensemble of runs contributed by a single model.\u00a0 These indices are defined as follows:\\    \u00a0</p> <ul> <li> <p>realization_index = an integer (\u22651) distinguishing among members of an ensemble of simulations that differ only in their initial conditions (e.g., initialized from different points in a control run).\u00a0 Note that if two different simulations were started from the same initial conditions, the same realization number should be used for both simulations.\u00a0 For example if a historical run with \u201cnatural forcing\u201d only and another historical run that includes anthropogenic forcing were both spawned at the same point in a control run, both should be assigned the same realization.\u00a0 Also, each so-called RCP (future scenario) simulation should normally be assigned the same realization integer as the historical run from which it was initiated.\u00a0 This will allow users to easily splice together the appropriate historical and future runs.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>initialization_index = an integer (\u22651), which should be assigned a value of 1 except to distinguish simulations performed under the same conditions but with different initialization procedures.\u00a0 In CMIP6 this index should invariably be assigned the value \u201c1\u201d except for some hindcast and forecast experiments called for by the DCPP activity.\u00a0 The initialization_index can be used either to distinguish between different algorithms used to impose initial conditions on a forecast or to distinguish between different observational datasets used to initialize a forecast.</p> </li> <li> <p>physics_index = an integer (\u22651) identifying the physics version used by the model.\u00a0 In the usual case of a single physics version of a model, this argument should normally be assigned the value 1, but it is essential that a consistent assignment of physics_index be used across all simulations performed by a particular model.\u00a0 Use of\u00a0 \u201cphysics_index\u201d is reserved for closely-related model versions (e.g., as in a \u201cperturbed physics\u201d ensemble) or for the same model run with slightly different parameterizations (e.g., of cloud physics).\u00a0 Model versions that are substantially different from one another should be given a different source_id\u201d (rather than simply assigning a different value of the physics_index).\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>forcing_index = an integer (\u22651) used to distinguish runs conforming to the protocol of a single CMIP6 experiment, but with different variants of forcing applied.\u00a0 One can, for example, distinguish between two historical simulations, one forced with the CMIP6-recommended forcing data sets and another forced by a different dataset, which might yield information about how forcing uncertainty affects the simulation.\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each data provider can assign whatever positive integers they like\u00a0 for the realization_index, intialization_index, physics_index, and forcing index.\u00a0 For each source/experiment pair, however, consistency (in these indices) should be maintained across each parent/child pair whenever sensible (so that, for example, both the ScenarioMIP child and its \u201chistorical\u201d parent simulation would be assigned the same set of index values for realization, initialization, and physics); the integer 1 should normally be chosen for each of these in the case of a single variant or for the primary variant (if there is one).\u00a0 This is only a suggestion, however; there should be no expectation on the part of users that every model will have a value of 1 assigned to any of the r, i, p, f indices, and even if a

The further_info_url page will be maintained by the es-docs project and will\u00a0 simply be a rendering by the Viewer tool of information provided by modeling groups and recorded in so-called CIM documents.</p> </li> <li> <p>The \u201cgrid\u201d global attribute can be used to describe the horizontal grid and regridding procedure. \u00a0 There is no standard form used to record this information, but it is suggested that when appropriate the following be indicated:\u00a0 brief description of native grid and resolution, and if data have been regridded, regridding procedure and description of target grid.\u00a0 Here are some examples:</p> <pre><code>grid = \u201cnative atmosphere T63 gaussian grid (128x64 lonxlat)\u201d\ngrid = \u201cdata regridded to a CMIP6 standard 1x1 degree lonxlat grid from the native T63 grid using an area-average preserving method.\u201d\ngrid = \u201cdata regridded via\u00a0 bilinear interpolation to a 3x3 deg lonxlat grid from the native atmosphere T63 gaussian grid (128x64 lonxlat)\u201d\ngrid = \u201cnative ocean tri-polar grid with 43200 ocean cells\u201d\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Modeling groups may choose to report their output on the model\u2019s native grid and/or regrid it to one or more target grids.\u00a0 To distinguish between output reported on different grids,\u00a0 a \u201cgrid_label\u201d attribute is defined.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>The rules for assigning grid labels\u00a0 should make it easy for users to select (using the ESGF search tools) CMIP output that is on a grid considered by each modeling group to best represent its model -- the so-called \u201cprimary\u201d grid.\u00a0 If output is reported on the native grid, this is always deemed the \u201cprimary\u201d grid.\u00a0 If output is not reported on the native grid, then modeling groups should regrid the data to some primary grid of its choosing \u00a0 For the \u201cprimary\u201d grid the following labels apply:</p> <pre><code>grid_label = \"gn\"\u00a0 (output is reported on the native grid, usually but not invariably at grid cell centers)\ngrid_label = \"gr\"\u00a0\u00a0 (output is _not_ reported on the native grid, but instead is regridded by the modeling group to a \u201cprimary grid\u201d of its choosing)\u00a0\ngrid_label = \u201cgm\u201d (global mean output is reported, so data are not gridded)\n</code></pre> <p>As noted below sometimes a \u201cz\u201d or \u201ca\u201d or \u201cg\u201d is appended to the labels to indicate \u201czonal means\u201d or grids limited to Antarctica or Greenland.\u00a0</p> <p>If besides the \u201cprimary\u201d grid, output is regridded to an additional grid, then for this output <code>grid_label = \"gr[i]\"</code>\u00a0 (a \u201csecondary\u201d grid), where <code>[i]</code> should be replaced by a positive\u00a0 integer less than 10, which distinguishes this output from other\u00a0 regridded output.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Note that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If model output is reported on a native grid, then if regridded output is also reported, it must not be labeled \u201cgr\u201d, but instead should be of the form gr[i] (e.g,, gr1, gr2, \u2026.).\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>The grid label provides no information about the grid other than to indicate whether or not the data have been regridded (from the native grid) and whether or not the grid is considered to be a \u201cprimary\u201d grid by the data provider.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Output for different variables may be reported on different grids, so \u201cgn\u201d and \u201cgr\u201d may not uniquely define a grid even within a single model.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a variable is reported on more than one grid,\u00a0 one of these grids must be labeled \u201cgn\u201d or \u201cgr\u201d (as appropriate), and others must be labeled as secondary grids (\u201cgr1\u201d, \u201cgr2\u201d, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>The grid labels (\u201cgr1\u201d, \u201cgr2\u201d, etc.)\u00a0 must be defined consistently for all variables reported from a single model on the same secondary grid.\u00a0 Thus,\u00a0 if \u201cgr3\u201d indicates output on a 2x2 degree grid for one variable, then the same label should be used for other variables output on this grid (unless for another variable output is considered to be primary, in which case the output would be labeled \u201cgn\u201d or \u201cgr\u201d, as appropriate).</p> </li> <li> <p>Output on the same grid but from different models will usually not be labeled with the same grid_label, since data providers independently assign the labels.</p> </li> <li> <p>A \u201cnominal_resolution\u201d attribute must be defined as specified in Appendix 2, and a brief description of the grid should be recorded in the \u201cgrid\u201d global attribute (see note 10).</p> </li> <li> <p>For zonal mean output, a \u201cz\u201d should be appended to the grid label that would apply before performing the zonal mean (e.g., \"gnz\", \"grz\", \"gr2z\").\u00a0 The \"gnz\" label would likely only be appropriate when zonally-averaging data on a native cartesian latxlon grid.</p> </li> <li> <p>For \u201csite\u201d data the label \"gn\" should be used presuming data are obtained from the single native grid cell located nearest each site.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>For \u201ctransport through a straight\u201d (and the like), the grid label should reflect the grid relied on in calculating the transport (presumably the native grid would be best for this purpose, so \u201cgn\u201d).</p> </li> <li> <p>For output reported only over the region centered on Greenland, \u201cg\u201d should be appended to the grid_label (e.g., \u201cgng\u201d, \u201cgrg\u201d,\u00a0 \u201cgr1g\u201d).\u00a0 Similarly for output reported only over the region centered on Antarctica, \u201ca\u201d should be appended to the grid_label.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The

have the following characteristics:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Uniquely label each experiment within CMIP6 and distinguish experiments with specified conditions that differ in any way\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Easily be interpreted and remembered</p> </li> <li> <p>Facilitate representations of groups of experiments that are closely related (e.g., same forecast conditions but different start dates, or experiment with an \u201coffline\u201d model driven by output from various models)\u00a0</p> </li> </ul> <p>Often several simulations will be performed that satisfy the conditions specified for an experiment.\u00a0 For example, simulations of the historical period can branch from various points in a control run, and each of these will satisfy the conditions defining the experiment.\u00a0 Together, such simulations constitute a \u201cconforming ensemble\u201d with members all satisfying the same experiment specifications.\u00a0 There are also occasional cases where the experiment designers (MIP leaders) define a family of related simulations and choose to label these with a common \u201croot\u201d experiment name, followed by a \u201csub-experiment\u201d name.\u00a0 An example of this is the set of decadal prediction hindcasts that are all run similarly but started from different start dates (with each simulation identified by a different sub-experiment label). \u00a0 Such \u201cdefined ensembles\u201d of experiments will be labeled with a \u201croot\u201d experiment name, and a \u201csub-experiment_id\u201d will be used to distinguish among members in the

indices stored as global attributes:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>variant_label = <code>r&lt;k&gt;i&lt;l&gt;p&lt;m&gt;f&lt;n&gt;</code> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where - k = realization_index - l = initialization_index - m = physics_index - n = forcing_index</p> </li> </ul> <p>Besides the above identifiers, additional descriptive information concerning the experiment is provided by the following global attributes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>experiment: brief descriptor of experiment (using CV)</p> </li> <li> <p>sub_experiment: brief descriptor of sub-experiment (using CV); if sub_experiment_id = \u201cnone\u201d, then sub_experiment = \u201cnone\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>variant_info: brief descriptor of what is unique about this \u201cripf\u201d variant.</p> </li> </ul>

Some changes will make it easier for users to find the data they need and will enable new services to be established providing, for example, model and experiment documentation and citation information.</p> <p>As in CMIP5, all CMIP6 output will be stored in netCDF files with one variable stored per file. The requested output fields can be determined as described above, and as in CMIP5, the data must be \u201ccmorized\u201d (i.e., written in conformance with all the CMIP standards). The CMIP standards build on the CF-conventions, which define metadata that provide a description of the variables and their spatial and temporal properties. This facilitates analysis of the data by users who can read and interpret data from all models in the same way.</p> <p>As described in section 6, it is recommended, but not required, that the CMOR software library be used to rewrite model output in conformance with the standards. In any case to ensure that a critical subset of the requirements have been met, a CMIP data checker (\"PrePARE\") will be applied before data are placed in the CMIP6 data archive.</p> <p>The CMIP6 data requirements are defined and discussed in the following documents:</p> <ul> <li>Definition of CMIP6 netCDF global attributes</li> <li>Reference \u201ccontrolled vocabularies\u201d (CV\u2019s) for CMIP6</li> <li>Specifications for file names, directory structures,  and CMIP6 Data Reference Syntax (DRS)</li> <li>Specifications for output file content, structure, and metadata are available in draft google doc.

Many of these are recognized by CMOR (through input via the CMIP6 CMOR Tables), which will ensure compliance.</p> <p>Note that in the above, controlled vocabularies (CV\u2019s) play a key role in ensuring uniformity in the description of data sets across all models. For all but variable-specific information, reference CV\u2019s are being maintained by PCMDI against which all quality assurance checks will be performed. These CV\u2019s will be relied on in constructing file names and directory structures, and they will enable faceted searches of the CMIP6 archive as called for in the search requirements document. Additional, variable-specific CVs are part of the CMIP6 Data Request. These CV\u2019s are structured in a way that makes clear relationships between certain items appearing in separate CV\u2019s. For example, the CV for model names (\u201csource_id\u201d) indicates which institutions are authorized to run each model, and the complete list of institutions is recorded in a CV for \u201cinstitution_id\u201d.</p> <p>As indicated in the guidance specifications for output grids, weights should be provided to regrid all output to a few standard grids (e.g., 1x1 degree).

Specifications for the required standard format will be forthcoming.</p> <p>CMIP6 output requirements that are critical for successful ingestion and access via ESGF will be enforced when publication of the data is initiated. The success of CMIP6 depends on making sure that even the requirements that can not be checked by ESGF are met. This is the responsibility of anyone preparing model output for CMIP6.

Use of CMOR is not mandatory, but past experience suggests that many common errors in model output files can be avoided by its use.</p> <p>For those not using CMOR, some checks for compliance with CMIP specifications can be performed using a new code developed in support of CMIP6: the Pre-Publication Attribute Reviewer for ESGF (PrePARE). For information about tests performed by PrePARE, view the design requirements.

Here is a summary of the main steps and requirements in the procedure:</p> <ul> <li>CMIP6 data compliance checking: Before data are passed to the data node for  publication, modeling centers should check that it is in conformance with all  the output requirements outlined in the sections above</li> <li>Selection of an ESGF data node: Modeling centers can either set up and host  their own ESGF data node or engage with an existing ESGF node. In either case  certain rules must be followed as outlined in the \"ESGF Data Node Managers and Operators\"  guide. If the node hosting the data has not been designated \u201cTier 1\u201d, then one  of the Tier 1 nodes will have to be selected to serve as the publication site.  Improperly configured data nodes will not be accessible through the federated  ESGF system</li> <li>Data transfer and ESGF data management: In addition to putting in place a  procedure for smoothly transferring and publishing CMIP6 data, a clearly defined  process for handling corrections to flawed data should be established. This would  include a formal procedure for recording \u201cerrata\u201d information in the case of correction  and replacement of erroneous data</li> <li>Data publication: The ESGF data node managers are responsible for ESGF data  publication and storage as described more completely in the \"ESGF Data Node Managers and Operators\"  guide. Publication of data not meeting the minimal CMIP6 data quality requirements  will be blocked</li> <li>Data replication: Some of the Tier 1 nodes plan to replicate some of the  data published by other nodes. This will provide some redundancy across the federation  protecting against loss of at least some of the data in the event of a catastrophic  storage failure at one node. It will also provide a backup source of data when  one node is temporarily offline. Not all data will be replicated, so it is recommended  that modeling groups retain a backup copy of their model output</li> <li>Data access: After data publication the CMIP6 data (as well as associated  errata information, documentation and citation information) will be visible and  accessible via the following designated CMIP6 data portals: PCMDI,  DKRZ, IPSL, CEDA, and others</li> <li>Data long-term archival: A \u201csnapshot\u201d of CMIP6 data as it exists at the time  of a deadline imposed by the IPCC\u2019s 6th Assessment Report (IPCC-AR6) will be archived  at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC DDC, http://ipcc-data.org)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CMIP6/guidance_for_modellers/#8-documentation-process","title":"8.

The new system retains the familiar short variable names used in earlier CMIP phases to denote a physical quantity (\"pr\" for precipitation, for example).  It introduces a new label, termed the branded suffix or branding label, that describes how a variable is sampled temporally and spatially. This label is used in the output filenames and directory path structures of CMIP7 datasets.</p> <p>For comparison with the previous CMIP naming scheme, consider the global monthly-mean near-surface air temperature, which in CMIP6 was denoted as \"tas\" in the \"Amon\" MIP table (also referred to as a CMOR table). A compound name constructed from these terms, \"Amon.tas\", uniquely identifies the variable. The \"Amon\" table is a collection of atmospheric variables at monthly frequency; other MIP tables (Omon, SImon, ...) collect together other variables that usually are similar in realm, frequency, and region. While familiar to experienced users of CMIP data, this system led to a proliferation of table names in CMIP6 due to the large number of requested variables (~2000), and the rationale for their names was not always clear (for example, table name \"Amon\" included the realm while \"3hr\" and \"day\" used only the frequency).</p> <p>The branded variable corresponding to \"Amon.tas\" is \"tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u\". Here the short name identifying the physical quantity, \"tas\", is unchanged. The branding label, \"tavg-h2m-hxy-u\", describes how the variable is temporally and spatially sampled and is composed of four parts:</p> <ul> <li>temporal label: \"tavg\" indicates a time average.</li> <li>vertical label: \"h2m\" indicates near-surface at 2m above ground.</li> <li>horizontal label: \"hxy\" indicates a horizontal field spanning latitude and longitude.</li> <li>area label: \"u\" indicates \"unmasked\".</li> </ul> <p>Branding labels are always composed of these four components, and their various possible values are tabulated below.</p> <p>Importantly, \"tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u\" is not fully equivalent to \"Amon.tas\".  This is because the branded variable name does not identify a variable's frequency, or its region. By additionally specifying the frequency as monthly, and the region as global, \"tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u\" then becomes equivalent to \"Amon.tas\". The same branded variable could alternately be reported at other frequencies, or for other regions. For example, \"tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u\" reported at daily frequency is denoted \"day.tas\" in CMIP6.</p> <p>Viewing branded variables in the Data Request</p> <p>The branded variable name, frequency, and region of every requested variable are specified in the CMIP7 Data Request, and can be viewed using Airtable, the github-based web viewer, or the python API.</p> <p>For every variable, the Data Request specifies both its CMIP7-era branded name and CMIP6-era name. This provides a mapping from old to new names, to simplify the transition to branded names. The \"Variables\" table of the Data Request provides a unique identifier using both flavours of name, termed \"CMIP7 Compound Name\" and \"CMIP6 Compound Name\". For the above example (monthly near-surface air temperature) these are \"atmos.tas.tavg-h2m-hxy-u.mon.GLB\" and \"Amon.tas\", respectively.</p> <p>The branded variable approach (Taylor et al., in preparation) aims to be more systematic and scalable to future CMIP phases and wider use across community MIPs. CMOR tables keyed by branded variable name define the metadata characteristics of variables apart from the frequency, region, or specific grids on which these variables should be reported. Guidance on reporting grids for CMIP output is given here. The exact reporting convention and associated CV is being finalised.

These may be viewed in the Data Request using Airtable (\"Variables\" tab, 3rd from left) or in the web viewer.</p> <p>Data producers should note that Controlled Vocabularies (CVs) play a key role in ensuring uniformity in the description of datasets across all models.

In addition to the DECK, each modeling group may choose to contribute to any of the CMIP7 Community MIPs. The CMIP panel identifies key experiments to be prioritized on different timelines through fast tracks. The first one is the AFT, which includes a set of Community MIP experiments endorsed by the CMIP panel to address specific needs.</p> <p>MORE COMING SOON</p>"},{"location":"CMIP7/guidance_for_users/#33-variable","title":"3.3.

CMIP7 data include a <code>calendar</code> attribute associated with the <code>time</code> coordinate, which determines how dates are represented. Before working with any CMIP dataset, users should check the calendar type and handle it appropriately.</p> <p>Common calendars found in CMIP data include:</p> <ul> <li>gregorian (or standard) \u2014 follows the real-world Gregorian calendar including leap years.  </li> <li>noleap \u2014 identical to Gregorian but without leap days (365 days every year).  </li> <li>360_day \u2014 each year has 12 months of 30 days (total 360 days).  </li> <li>proleptic_gregorian \u2014 a continuous Gregorian calendar extended backward in time.  </li> <li>all_leap \u2014 every year has 366 days (all years include a leap day).</li> </ul> <p>These calendars are stored in the <code>calendar</code> attribute of the <code>time</code> variable, for example:</p> <pre><code>ncdump -h tas_day_ACCESS-ESM1-5_ssp585.nc | grep calendar\n</code></pre> <p>Further reading in CF conventions for time coordinate: https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.12/cf-conventions.html#time-coordinate</p> <p>It is recommended that users use the cftime library to handle time.</p>"},{"location":"CMIP7/guidance_for_users/#35-grid","title":"3.5 Grid","text":"<ul> <li>List of grids (coming soon)</li> <li>List of pressure levels: Table 2 of Dingley et al. 2025</li> <li>CMIP7 Guidance on Grids</li> </ul> <p>Different climate models use a variety of different horizontal grids that are documented in the grid registry (coming soon).</p> <p>Different MIPs also have different requirements for vertical grid reporting. Output can be defined either on the native model levels, or it can be remapped to pressure levels.</p> Masked Averaging <p>Many variables in CMIP7 are defined as masked means, defined as the mean of a quantity over a portion of the grid cell defined by an area type.

Reporting suspected errors","text":"<p>Information about discovered issues of CMIP7 data is captured by the Errata Service.</p> <p>Any CMIP data user can report an error by submitting an issue through the Propose button on the Errata Service website. Proposing erratum through the webform requires a contact email address. Once the webform is validated and created, a special link is created and can be shared but the issue won\u2019t appear on the index page. A moderator (from the relevant modelling centre providing data) will validate, update or reject the entry. When data errors are discovered, data providers are expected to retract the affected datasets from ESGF and, if possible, republish corrected data using updated dataset version identifiers. If no moderation action is taken after the 14-day validation period, the issue will be publicly indexed, albeit with a special flag.</p>"},{"location":"CMIP7/guidance_for_users/#6-new-to-cmip","title":"6.
