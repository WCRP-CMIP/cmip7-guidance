# CMIP7 Participation Guidance for Modellers

## 1. Requirements & Expectations

Groups who plan to participate in CMIP7 should (in roughly this order, although model documentation should be 
provided as early as possible):

* Indicate your intention to participate by registering your institution and model with the 
  [CMIP7 Controlled Vocabularies](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP7-CVs) when the registration
  process is available. Publication of your model output (on ESGF) will not be possible
  without first registering your institution and model, which includes providing the
  *Essential Model Documentation* for your model. The list of currently registered
  institutions can be found at ***link needed*** and the registration process is 
  via ***link needed***.

* Ensure that you have joined the modelling group mailing list -- if unsure please 
  contact the [CMIP IPO](mailto:cmip-ipo@esa.int) for further details.

* Following, or as part of, the registration of your models you will be able to indicate your
  intention to participate in community MIPs through the `activity_participation` information
  for your models. Information on community MIPs can be found [here](https://wcrp-cmip.org/mips).

* Perform required DECK and MIP experiments, using the required 
  [standard forcing datasets](https://input4mips-cvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset-overviews/).

* Save all requested model output as specified in the 
  [Data Request](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phases/cmip7/cmip7-data-request/) where possible (see section 4 below).
  Prioritise the [Baseline Climate Variables](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/18/2639/2025/), a group of 135 variables that are requested from all experiments.


* Document all simulations including forcing information and a description of ensemble variants
  (details to be clarified later).

* Prepare and make available model output according to CMIP7 specifications (see sections 5, 6, 
  and 7 below).

* Plans for DOI registration and citation facilities are under consideration and 
  further information will be provided in due course.

* Correct published data when errors are discovered. Errors should be documented using the
  [ES-DOC Errata Service](https://errata.ipsl.fr/) before further action is taken, e.g. retraction
  and publication of replacement datasets.  Please note that the Errata Service supports 
  [user proposed issues](https://ipsl.gitbook.io/esgf-errata-service/errata-service-web-pages/propose-an-issue-through-webforms),
  which are moderated and passed to modelling groups as required. Further information about the
  service is available in the 
  [Errata Service Documentation](https://ipsl.gitbook.io/esgf-errata-service).
