## Editing the documentation.

Docmentation is found in the `docs` folder with the file names and hierarchy affecting the navigational menu. 

### Editing materials. 

- menu/page name is determined by the `#` header tag at the top of a file. 

## MkDocs setup for development

1. Create a conda environment with mkdocs. From the root of this repo;
   
    `conda env create -f environment.yml`
   
3. when complete activate the conda environment and run
   
    `mkdocs serve`
   
   You should see the link to a local process that is running a webserver -- connect to that and you can browse the pages as you edit them.
